# Product Requirements Document: AI Agent Calling Tool

## Introduction/Overview

The AI Agent Calling Tool is a personal web application that enables users to leverage AI agents to make phone calls on their behalf using the Vapi API. The tool solves the problem of time-consuming personal phone tasks by automating calls for appointments, reservations, inquiries, and other personal tasks. Users can define what they want the agent to accomplish, monitor call progress, and receive detailed transcripts and analysis of the conversation outcomes.

## Goals

1. **Automate Personal Phone Tasks**: Enable users to delegate routine phone calls to an AI agent
2. **Simplify Call Configuration**: Provide an intuitive interface for setting up calls with custom prompts
3. **Provide Call Visibility**: Give users real-time status updates and comprehensive post-call information
4. **Maintain Call History**: Keep a searchable log of all calls made through the system
5. **Deliver Actionable Insights**: Provide both raw transcripts and AI-generated summaries of call outcomes

## User Stories

1. **As a user**, I want to configure a general system prompt so that my AI agent has consistent personality and behavior across all calls.

2. **As a user**, I want to enter a specific prompt for each call so that I can tell the agent exactly what to accomplish during the conversation.

3. **As a user**, I want to initiate a call through the web interface so that I can start the automated calling process easily.

4. **As a user**, I want to see when my call is in progress so that I know the agent is actively working on my task.

5. **As a user**, I want to receive a complete transcript after the call so that I can review exactly what was discussed.

6. **As a user**, I want to get an AI-generated summary of the call so that I can quickly understand the outcome without reading the full transcript.

7. **As a user**, I want to view my call history so that I can reference previous calls and their outcomes.

## Functional Requirements

### Core Functionality
1. The system must provide a settings page where users can configure a general system prompt for the AI agent
2. The system must allow users to enter call-specific prompts describing what the agent should accomplish
3. The system must integrate with the Vapi API to initiate and manage phone calls
4. The system must display a "call in progress" indicator when a call is active
5. The system must capture and store complete call transcripts
6. The system must generate AI-powered summaries and analysis of call outcomes
7. The system must provide a call history page showing all previous calls with timestamps

### User Interface
8. The system must provide a clean, intuitive web interface for call management
9. The system must have a main dashboard for initiating new calls
10. The system must include a settings section for system prompt configuration
11. The system must display call status updates in real-time
12. The system must present transcripts and summaries in an easy-to-read format

### Data Management
13. The system must store call records including prompts, transcripts, summaries, and metadata
14. The system must allow users to search and filter call history
15. The system must persist system prompt settings between sessions

## Non-Goals (Out of Scope)

1. **Multi-user Support**: This is a personal tool and will not include user authentication or multi-tenant features
2. **Advanced Security**: No enterprise-level security features or encryption requirements
3. **Call Scheduling**: No ability to schedule calls for future execution
4. **Call Templates**: No pre-built templates for common call scenarios
5. **Live Audio Streaming**: No real-time audio monitoring during calls
6. **Mobile App**: Web-only interface, no native mobile applications
7. **Integration with External CRMs**: No third-party system integrations
8. **Advanced Analytics**: No detailed reporting or analytics dashboards

## Design Considerations

- **Simple and Clean UI**: Focus on ease of use with minimal cognitive load
- **Responsive Design**: Ensure the web app works well on desktop and tablet devices
- **Real-time Updates**: Use WebSocket or similar technology for live call status updates
- **Clear Visual Hierarchy**: Distinguish between system settings, call configuration, and results
- **Accessible Design**: Follow basic accessibility guidelines for form inputs and content display

## Technical Considerations

- **Vapi API Integration**: Primary dependency on Vapi API for call functionality
- **Real-time Communication**: WebSocket connection for call status updates
- **Data Storage**: Local database (SQLite or similar) for storing call history and settings
- **Frontend Framework**: Modern web framework (React, Vue, or similar) for responsive UI
- **Backend API**: RESTful API for managing calls, settings, and history
- **AI Integration**: OpenAI or similar API for generating call summaries and analysis

## Success Metrics

1. **Call Completion Rate**: Target 95% successful call completion rate
2. **User Satisfaction**: Subjective measure of whether calls accomplish intended goals
3. **System Reliability**: 99% uptime for the web application
4. **Response Time**: Call initiation within 30 seconds of user request
5. **Data Accuracy**: 100% transcript capture rate for completed calls

## Open Questions

1. **Call Duration Limits**: Should there be maximum call duration limits to control costs?
2. **Error Handling**: How should the system handle failed calls or API errors?
3. **Cost Monitoring**: Should the tool include Vapi API usage/cost tracking?
4. **Backup Strategy**: How should call data be backed up or exported?
5. **System Prompt Versioning**: Should there be version control for system prompt changes?
6. **Call Retry Logic**: Should failed calls automatically retry or require manual intervention?
